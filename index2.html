            <br>Researchers have made leaps of progress on problems like generating text and answering questions by creating giant machine learning models trained on huge swaths of the online text. Google has said that technology has made its lucrative, eponymous search engine more powerful. But researchers have also shown that creating these more powerful models consumes large amounts of electricity because of the vast computing resources required, and documented how the models can replicate biased language on gender and race found online.<br><br><br>
            Gebru says her draft paper discussed those issues and urged responsible use of the technology, for example by documenting the data used to create language models. She was troubled when the senior manager insisted she and other Google authors either remove their names from the paper or retract it altogether, particularly when she couldn’t learn the process used to review the draft. “I felt like we were being censored and thought this had implications for all of ethical AI research,” she says.<br><br><br><br><br>
            Gebru says she failed to convince the senior manager to work through the issues with the paper; she says the manager insisted that she remove her name. Tuesday Gebru emailed back offering a deal: If she received a full explanation of what happened, and the research team met with management to agree on a process for fair handling of future research, she would remove her name from the paper. If not, she would arrange to depart the company at a later date, leaving her free to publish the paper without the company’s affiliation.<br><br><br>
            Gebru also sent an email to a wider list within Google’s AI research group saying that managers’ attempts to improve diversity had been ineffective. She included a description of her dispute about the language paper as an example of how Google managers can silence people from marginalized groups. Platformer published a copy of the email Thursday. Wednesday, Gebru says, she learned from her direct reports that they had been told she had resigned from Google and that her resignation had been accepted. She discovered her corporate account was disabled.<br><br><br>
            An email sent by a manager to Gebru’s personal address said her resignation should take effect immediately because she had sent an email reflecting “behavior that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.” Gebru took to Twitter, and outrage quickly grew among AI researchers online. Many criticizing Google, both from inside and outside the company, noted that the company had at a stroke damaged the diversity of its AI workforce and also lost a prominent advocate for improving that diversity. Gebru suspects her treatment was in part motivated by her outspokenness around diversity and Google’s treatment of people from marginalized groups. "We have been pleading for representation, but there are barely any Black people in Google Research, and, from what I see, none in leadership whatsoever," she says.<br><br><br>
            Thursday, Google’s research head Jeff Dean sent an email to company researchers claiming that Gebru’s paper “didn’t meet our bar for publication” and that she had submitted it for internal review later than the company requires.<br><br><br>
            His message also suggested the disputed paper was perceived as too negative by Google managers. Dean said the document discussed the environmental impact of large AI models but not research showing they could be made more efficient, and raised concerns about biased language without considering work on mitigating them. Some Google AI researchers disputed Dean’s characterization on Twitter; one accused him of spreading “misinformation and misconstruals.” Another Google researcher observed that his own papers were screened internally only for disclosure of sensitive information, not what work was cited. The disputed paper is undergoing peer review by an academic conference independent of Google and may still be published in some form.<br><br><br>Dean’s intervention fueled the anger felt by some AI researchers sympathetic to Gebru’s cause—something that could damage Google’s ability to retain and hire top AI talent pursued vigorously by all major tech companies.<br><br><br>
            “Even if we put aside the censorship of the article, firing a researcher that way is chilling,” says Julien Cornebise, an honorary associate professor at University College London who previously worked at Alphabet’s London AI lab DeepMind and has talked with AI researchers inside and outside of Google about Gebru’s plight. “There’s a feeling of incredulity, astonishment, and outrage.”<br><br><br>
